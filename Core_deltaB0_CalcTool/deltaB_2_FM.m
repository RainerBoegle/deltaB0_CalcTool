function FieldMap = deltaB_2_FM(ChiSize_deltaB,ParameterStruct,Chi) %WIP: ShimValues & BackgroundField should be included! 
% This function masks the field at all points which would not be visible for MR to approximate the distribution of a field map.
% WIP Notes:
%     Additionally to the IDEALIZED CALCULATION of the field done by the
%     function "Calc_deltaB", which ASSUMES A PERFECTLY HOMOGENEOUS B0 FIELD
%     we HAVE TO INCLUDE THE INHOMOGENEITIES OF THE SCANNER AND THE SHIM FIELDS!
%     
%     For this reason we also need the position and orientation of the Object.
%     Then we just have to take the measured background field and transform
%     it according to the position and orientation of the object and add it
%     to the results of "Calc_deltaB".
% WIP_END
%
% Structure of the function until now:
%   1.) Copy Tensor ChiSize_deltaB to FieldMap Tensor. 
%       WIP: Add transformed background fields and shim fields
%   2.) Go through the MR_invisible Table in the ParameterStruct and
%   3.) Use comparison with Values of Chi to select Voxels to set to zero in FieldMap Tensor.
%
%INPUT:
%       ChiSize_deltaB  -- The field inhomogeneity in the position and extend of the susceptibility distribution Chi repressenting the object which is imaged.
%                             (The Format is always (y,x,z). Maybe this needs to be rethought in the future.)

%% 1.)
FieldMap = ChiSize_deltaB;

%WIP:
% Lets say we input the field measured in a sphere as a measure of the BACKGROUND FIELD 
% then we have to apply the inverse rotation of the B0 field to obtain the right field
% which we have to add to the calculated field for correction. 
% (Because the object really moved while the BACKGROUND field and B0 stays fixed,
%  -it is only due to motion correction that the BACKGROUND & B0 field apparently moved!)
% The code should look something like this:
%
%       BackgroundField_alpha_degrees= - B_0_Orientation * 2*pi /360; %Angle in degrees for rotation; OPPOSITE to the B0 orientation.
%       SphereFieldMap_rotated = imrotate(SphereFieldMap,BackgroundField_alpha_degrees,'bilinear','crop');
%       FieldMap= ChiSize_deltaB + SphereFieldMap_rotated; %This is the corrected field, including the Background field.
% Remark:
%        Dynamic Shimming can be included in the same way if the Shim values used for dyn. correction have been stored and the appropriate field can be calculated.
